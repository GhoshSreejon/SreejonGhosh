# Welcome to My Project

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Sreejon** — a passionate developer focused on creating modern, user-friendly web applications. I specialize in front-end development and enjoy building responsive, interactive UIs with the latest technologies.

You can explore more of my work on my [portfolio](https://sreejon.vercel.app).

## Project Info

This project showcases a combination of my skills in **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It’s designed to provide a seamless user experience, optimized for performance, and includes modern web features.

### Technologies Used:

- **Vite** – A fast development build tool.
- **React** – For building dynamic user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** – For type safety and scalability.
- **Tailwind CSS** – For utility-first styling and fast design.
- **shadcn-ui** – For reusable UI components and design systems.

## How to Edit and Develop Locally

To make changes and contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/GhoshSreejon/SreejonGhosh.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```sh
    cd SreejonGhosh
    ```

3. **Install necessary dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start a development server with hot-reloading, allowing you to view changes in real-time.

## How to Deploy

Deploy this project using your preferred deployment platform. I recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), as it offers seamless integration with **React** and **Vite**.

1. Push your changes to the main branch.
2. Link the repository to your Vercel account.
3. Vercel will automatically deploy your project.

## How to Add a Custom Domain

You can connect a custom domain by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings > Domains**.
2. Click **Connect Domain** and follow the setup guide.

### Animation and Interactive Features

This project includes **smooth fade-in animations** that make the interface engaging. All components (such as buttons, text, and images) animate when they enter the viewport.

You can find animation effects by using libraries like [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) or [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/). These libraries allow you to add complex animations easily, such as:

- **Fade-in effects**
- **Slide-up animations**
- **Hover effects on buttons**
